# **üß† Machine Learning**
Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that which makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn. Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect.

## **üìö Types of machine learning**
There are various ways to classify machine learning problems. Here, we discuss the most obvious ones.

1. **Supervised learning**

2. **Unsupervised learning**

3. **Reinforcement learning**

4. **Classification**

5. **Regression**

## **üöÄ Quick Discussion**
Let's discuss all the ways by which we do machine learning

### **1. üßê Supervised Learning**
 The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a ‚Äúteacher‚Äù, and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves the desired level of accuracy on the training data.

 #### **Used Cases**
 - **Image Classification :** *You train with images/labels. Then in the future you give a new image expecting that the computer will recognize the new object.*

 - **Market Prediction/Regression :** *You train the computer with historical market data and ask the computer to predict the new price in the future.*

### **2. ü§π Unsupervised Learning**
No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. It is used for clustering population in different groups. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data).

#### **Includes**
- **Clustering :** *You train with images/labels. Then in the future you give a new image expecting that the computer will recognize the new object.*

- **High Dimension Visualization :** *Use the computer to help us visualize high dimension data.*

- **Generative Models :** *After a model captures the probability distribution of your input data, it will be able to generate more data. This can be very useful to make your classifier more robust.*

The data in supervised learning is labelled & distinguishes data points as **[O]** & **[X]** | The data in supervised learning is not labelled as all the data points are labeled **[O]**

### **3. ü§π Reinforcement learning**
A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). The program is provided feedback in terms of rewards and punishments as it navigates its problem space.
